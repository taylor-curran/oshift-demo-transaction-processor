# Transaction Processor

## Artifact Design Thinking

**Platform**: Traditional Cloud Foundry | **Complexity**: High

High-throughput transaction processing engine demonstrating enterprise-scale banking operations:

- **High-performance configuration** - 5 instances with 2GB memory each for scale
- **Database sharding** - 4 separate database instances for horizontal scalability
- **Kafka streaming** - real-time transaction processing with optimized consumer settings
- **JVM performance tuning** - G1 garbage collector with specific heap settings
- **Circuit breaker patterns** - Hystrix for system resilience
- **Enterprise health checks** - extended timeouts for complex processing

### Key Features
- Multi-shard database architecture with high-throughput Kafka consumers
- Circuit breaker and retry patterns with batch processing (1000 record batches)
- Comprehensive service dependencies (audit, metrics, multiple DBs)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17, Maven 3.6+

### Run
```bash
# Install dependencies
mvn clean install

# Run tests
mvn test

# Run locally (requires Kafka and PostgreSQL)
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Deploy
```bash
cf push
```
